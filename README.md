Lightweight React component to create css-based masonry-like layouts.  
Snuggle all your components really tight 🛌

[Demo](https://significa.github.io/react-snuggle/)

Like a loving couple snuggling in bed, `react-snuggle` basically tries to make everything very intimate and comfortable by filling every space available (using CSS grid and a bit of javascript).

## Features

- **🤟 Responsive:** It works on all size screens;
- **🤙 Customizable:** Easily change how your elements should snuggle;
- **🤝 Use your favorite library:** CSS-in-JS, css modules, plain css, whatever. Feel free to use whatever you want;
- **💪 Performance:** Responsive solution based only in CSS (without any JS Event Listener).

#### Install:

```sh
yarn add react-snuggle
```

#### Usage:

```jsx
import Snuggle from "react-snuggle";

const List = () => (
  <Snuggle>
    <div>Item</div>
    <div>Item</div>
    ...
  </Snuggle>
);
```
